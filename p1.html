                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involves designing a system to check-in passengers and transfer their luggage from the airport baggage tunnel (Plate A) to the airplane storage (Plate B).
                    In this project we designed a mechanism using solid models and actuators, with a Q-arm to handle luggage placement.
                    The software component includes scanning passenger and luggage data from text files to generate a summary.
                    This summary is displayed visually through the use of turtle graphics.

            <h3>There are three main functions our project had to accomplish:</h3>
            <div class="box-no-link">
                <h3>Function 1</h3>
                <p>Utilize Q-arm to transport luggage from the "conveyor belt", which is a rotary table, that held the mini luggage to either the rejection bin or to the airport baggage tunnel (Plate A). The luggage is also scanned to determine its destination before being grabbed by the Q-arm .</p>

                </div>
                <p>We accomplised this by scanning the barcode of the luggage which would return a string of text saying "platform" or "rejection bin".
                    It then used a conditional statement to tell the arm to go to either the rejection bin or the platform after grabbing the luggage.
                    An idea I had which helped greatly in the end, was to use individual movement commands for the Q-arm instead of coordinates.
                    When using coordinates the Q-arm will take variable paths to get there and would sometimes hit things along the way.
                    Using indivudal movement commands, we were able to ensure the Q-arm took the same path every time.

                <p>Transport the luggage from the airport baggage tunnel (plate A) to the plane baggage storage (plate B) using a specialized mechanism. There is also a restriction line in which the mechanims cannot cross while it is in the initial position.</p>

                    Our team's design acomplished this with a linear actuator positioned below the slide which can extend and retract to move the slide out of the restricted area. 
                    When in the lowered position, the Q-arm drops the luggage on the top and it slides down to the bottom.
                    This is the part of the project where I spent most of my time.
                    I created multiple prototypes for this design as well as another design concept that we ended up not using in the end.

                Our team's code processing works by reading the two files called passenger data and fleet data. It then uses 5 different functions to count things individually.
                These functions are daily data, fleet data, oversold, overweight, and layover. 
                The function I worked on which was daily data, works by reading the passenger list and saving all of the different gate numbers. 
                It then counts how many business and economy passengers are at each gate. 
                From there, it reads and saves which planes are at which gates. 
                Finally, it outputs a list of each plane and how many business and economy passengers there are.
                This data isn't directly displayed in the graphical summary, but it is used in the oversold function made by someone else in our group.
                The graphical funtion takes the data from all of our teams functions and displays it in boxes for for each plane.

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                    During the design proccess we went through many iterations. 
                    The main difference between our original ideas and the final product is the actuator we used.
                    In prototype 1, we used a rotary actuator and a string to lift the bridge.
                    We suspected the rotary actuator's power was insufficient and there were stability issues with the platform the rotary actuator was mounted on.
                    There was also the issue of how we were going to drop off the luggage onto the ramp without hitting the platform with linear actuator.
                    Because of this, we switched to the linear actuator sovling both our problems.
                    The only other issue was the connection of the linear actuator with the slide.
                    To solve this, I created a rail under the slide for a piece mounted to the linear actuator to follow.
                    For the second prototype, we were pretty confident in the design functioning as intended.
                    However, during testing the linear actuator was unstable and would push itself over.
                    To solve this we added a support to the side of it to ensure it was completely stable for our presentation.

                <p>
                    Looking back, this design can be made much less complicated. 
                    Instead of a rail and an attachment for the linear actuator we could have simply placed the linear acutator underneath pushing directly on the slide.
                    During testing we were able to get the slide to go up without the rails and attachment.
                    The reason we kept the rails and attachment was becasuse the slide wansn't clearing the restriction line without them.
                    Another choice we could hae made differently was actually continuing with the rotary actuator design.
                    In hindsight, we were able to see other groups that used the linear actuator successfully. 
                    This led us to believe our original design could have worked with some small alterations.

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, the coding section of our project went very smooth as we ran into little to no issues.
                    We were all able to create our individual functions in a timely manner.
                    As for the team functions, we had a few issues with reading the passenger and fleet data files originally.
                    This is mainly because of our inexperience with reading files in python.
                    In the end, we realized that all we needed to do was read each line of the file, remove unnecessary information such as spaces and commas, and append each processed line to a list.
